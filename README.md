# files_task
A script with a solution and result to a task containing the following subsections:

## Part A:
  - Create 7 folders named: Monday, ... , Sunday
  - In every folder create 2 subfolders: morning, evening
  - In every subfolder create 'Solutions.csv' file.
  
  The 'Solutions.csv' should consist of two lines:
  1. " Model; Output value; Time of computation; "
  2. " A ; 17 ; 465s; "
  
  The first line is always the same.
  
  The second one should be generated randomly (x in {A,B,C}, 0-1000, 0-1000s)

## Part B:
  Output sum of "Time of computation" for the model A.
  
  Assume that you do not know how many folders and subfolders there are.
